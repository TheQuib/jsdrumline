We are the Jersey Shore Drumline. We bang drums, eat granola bars at unsafe speeds, and speak fluent dut. Our sticks are an extension of our souls. Our dot sheets are ancient scrolls passed down through generations (since like... 2017). No one really knows how we got here, but we rehearse in the parking lot and call it sacred ground.

Legend says if you say "clean" three times into a mirror while holding a drum pad, someone yells "AGAIN!" from behind you. We once played so well at a competition that a judge shed a single tear and then asked us to keep it down.

This site exists because OneDrive got messy and nobody ever checks their email. So here we are. United. Slightly off-tempo. Glorious.

Welcome to the line. Watch your dot. Respect the dut.
